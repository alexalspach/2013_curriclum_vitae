<h2>My name is Alex</h2>

<div class="well">

<p>
I am an American engineer with a passion for developing thoughtfully and creatively considered robotic, mechanical and software systems with great interest in user interaction. I have international experience working and researching on diverse teams in both academia and industry.
</p>

<p>
I hold Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from Drexel University. As a student of Dr. Paul Oh, I have been working and researching in robotics since the outset of my university career.
</p>

<p>
﻿While still in school, I spent seven months in South Korea’s Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) studying the manufacture and construction of their humanoid robot, HUBO. ﻿At Synthes Spine, I was involved in all phases of product development and was part of a two-engineer team heading the mechanical failure investigation of a recalled implant. Now a robotics engineer at SimLab in South Korea, my primary responsibilities are developing and marketing hardware and software tools for robotics research.
